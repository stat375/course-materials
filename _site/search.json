The questions below might be helpful to spur your thinking.\nPossible questions to address: 1. Does this reading resonate with your own experience or contrast with it? In what ways? 2. What are a few critiques one would make of the arguments presented? 3. How do the ideas present inform how you might change your teaching?\nIn place of posting a new comment, you can also reply to your fellow students’ comments. Any engagement and input is welcome as long as it’s original and respectful.\n\n\n\nThe topic for next class is “Teaching as a member of a team”, so in preparation, please reflect on the role you play as a (u)GSI in a paragraph for two for the question below. The second question is meant to be answered by your instructor, so please ask them for a few sentences about how they see the role of the GSI in their class.\nNote: if you know of other students in 375 that are also GSIing for the same class, coordinate your question so the instructor only has to answer once (and then send that answer around to your fellow GSIs). Also, if the instructor has spelled this out previous to you verbally or in writing, you’re welcome to transcribe that.\nIf possible, write your answer to 1 before hearing the instructor’s response in 2.\n\n\nWhat do you think your role is as a GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do you have to your students? What responsibilities do you have towards your instructor?\n\n\n\nWhat do you see as the role of GSI in the broader context of the course?

The siege resulted in Breda, a Dutch fortified city, falling into the control of the Army of Flanders.\nFollowing the orders of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV’s army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was contrary to the wishes of Philip IV’s government because of the already excessive burdens of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years’ wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege.\n.cite[Source: Wikipedia]\n\n\nThe Siege of Breda was a dramatic event in Spanish history. It occured in the 17th century as a part of the Eighty years war. The Spanish Army, under the commander Ambrogio Spinola, representing King Philip V of Spain laid siege to the city in August at a time when sieges were thought to no longer be effect tools in a military campaign. The city of Breda was well-defended and were confident they would win."

    "text": "Siege of Breda, cont.\nYet despite the Spanish government’s opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city’s defences and driving off a Dutch relief army under the leadership of Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army’s access to supplies.\nThe siege of Breda is considered Spinola’s greatest success and one of Spain’s last major victories in the Eighty Years’ War. The siege was part of a plan to isolate the Republic from its hinterland, and co-ordinated with Olivare’s naval war spearheaded by the Dunkirkers, to economically choke the Dutch Republic. Although political infighting hindered Spinola’s freedom of movement, Spain’s efforts in the Netherlands continued thereafter.\n\nbackground-image: url(figs/velasquez.jpeg) background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: contain;\n\nbackground-color: #000000\n\n##The Siege of Breda\n\nWhere is Breda? Netherlands\nWhich two wars were going on at this time? Eighty Years War and Thirty Years War.\nWho was the King of Spain in this era? Philip IV.\nWhat is the name of the painting? The Surrender of Breda.\nWhy was the Siege of Breda important? Restored the pride and reputation of the spanish army.\n\n\nOnce Spinola laid siege to the city, two relief efforts were made, first by the Dutch, then by the British. In the end, the city capitulated to Spinola in an event memorialized in a famous painting.\n\nThe reason why the Siege of Breda is important is that is restored the pride and reputation of the Spanish Army."
