Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students‚Äô perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods."

    "text": "Siege of Breda\nThe siege of Breda of 1624‚Äì25 occurred during the Eighty Years‚Äô War. The siege resulted in Breda, a Dutch fortified city, falling into the control of the Army of Flanders.\nFollowing the orders of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV‚Äôs army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was contrary to the wishes of Philip IV‚Äôs government because of the already excessive burdens of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years‚Äô wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThe Siege of Breda was a dramatic event in Spanish history. It occured in the 17th century as a part of the Eighty years war. The Spanish Army, under the commander Ambrogio Spinola, representing King Philip V of Spain laid siege to the city in August at a time when sieges were thought to no longer be effect tools in a military campaign. The city of Breda was well-defended and were confident they would win."

    "text": "Siege of Breda, cont.\nYet despite the Spanish government‚Äôs opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city‚Äôs defences and driving off a Dutch relief army under the leadership of Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army‚Äôs access to supplies.\nThe siege of Breda is considered Spinola‚Äôs greatest success and one of Spain‚Äôs last major victories in the Eighty Years‚Äô War. The siege was part of a plan to isolate the Republic from its hinterland, and co-ordinated with Olivare‚Äôs naval war spearheaded by the Dunkirkers, to economically choke the Dutch Republic. Although political infighting hindered Spinola‚Äôs freedom of movement, Spain‚Äôs efforts in the Netherlands continued thereafter.\n\nOnce Spinola laid siege to the city, two relief efforts were made, first by the Dutch, then by the British. In the end, the city capitulated to Spinola in an event memorialized in a famous painting.\n(on the next slide)\nThis is the surrender at Breda by Velasquez\ndescribe what you see"

While the campus is under COVID restrictions, class will be held on Zoom.\n\n\nMissing class and assignments\nIf you are feeling unwell, please stay home. Your health and that of the community come first. Materials for all of the course sessions will appear on the course website. Part of the weekly assignments will bear on what is discussed in class, so do your best given your absence from that discussion. If continued absence might endanger passing the class, the instructor will be in touch to discuss options.\n\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nSTAT 375 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have Letters of Accommodations from the Disabled Students‚Äô Program or another authorized office, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements."
