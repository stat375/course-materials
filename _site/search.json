Willingham, posted to bCourses.\nAfterwards, please post to Ed your thoughts (a paragraph or two) on the reading selection. The questions below might be helpful to spur your thinking.\nPossible questions to address: 1. Does this reading resonate with your own experience or contrast with it? In what ways? 2. What are a few critiques one would make of the arguments presented? 3. How do the ideas present inform how you might change your teaching?\nIn place of posting a new comment, you can also reply to your fellow students‚Äô comments. Any engagement and input is welcome as long as it‚Äôs original and respectful.\n\n\nReflections\nThe topic for next class is ‚ÄúTeaching as a member of a team‚Äù, so in preparation, please reflect on the role you play as a (u)GSI in a paragraph for two for the question below. The second question is meant to be answered by your instructor, so please ask them for a few sentences about how they see the role of the GSI in their class.\nNote: if you know of other students in 375 that are also GSIing for the same class, coordinate your question so the instructor only has to answer once (and then send that answer around to your fellow GSIs). Also, if the instructor has spelled this out previous to you verbally or in writing, you‚Äôre welcome to transcribe that.\nIf possible, write your answer to 1 before hearing the instructor‚Äôs response in 2.\n\n1. From the GSI\nWhat do you think your role is as a GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do you have to your students? What responsibilities do you have towards your instructor?\n\n\n2. From the Instructor\nWhat do you see as the role of GSI in the broader context of the course? What responsibilities do they have to the students? What responsibilities do you have towards you?"

    "text": "The primary goal of this course is to help first-time GSI appointments become more confident, efficient, and effective teachers. It aims to build in students a curiosity to persistently question their practice: Why am I teaching this particular topic? What is the most important thing that my students learn? How do I know if my students have learned it? Why have I chosen to teach it in the this manner? Why are certain students engaged and succeeding and others not?\nThere are three integral elements to this course. In person class meetings are the core of the experience, when you will encounter new ideas and discuss them in the context of your current teaching. Weekly assignments are an opportunity to reflect on the ideas discussed in class as well as readings. Teaching observations will occur twice during the semester and give you the opportunity to observe a different classroom environment than your own and receive feedback about your own teaching."

References will be posted to the course website along with information on how to access them.\n\n\nAssignments\nAssignments generally contain two components: a reflection on the previous week and a discussion question around the reading for the following week. Your reflection on the previous week will generally be submitted as an individual assignment to bbCourses and your responses to the reading questions will be posted to the discussion forum.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nOut-of-class communication for this course will be held on Ed. We will use this forum to host discussions about the readings for the week. It is also where you should turn to if you have a question about the course. Questions that concern sensitive and private topics should be sent as private message (these are readable only by course staff). All other questions should be posted as public notes to the forum so that course staff and fellow students can answer questions in a way that will be visible to others."

    "text": "Siege of Breda\nThe siege of Breda of 1624‚Äì25 occurred during the Eighty Years‚Äô War. The siege resulted in Breda, a Dutch fortified city, falling into the control of the Army of Flanders.\nFollowing the orders of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV‚Äôs army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was contrary to the wishes of Philip IV‚Äôs government because of the already excessive burdens of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years‚Äô wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\n\nThe Siege of Breda was a dramatic event in Spanish history. It occured in the 17th century as a part of the Eighty years war. The Spanish Army, under the commander Ambrogio Spinola, representing King Philip V of Spain laid siege to the city in August at a time when sieges were thought to no longer be effect tools in a military campaign. The city of Breda was well-defended and were confident they would win."

    "text": "Siege of Breda, cont.\nYet despite the Spanish government‚Äôs opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city‚Äôs defences and driving off a Dutch relief army under the leadership of Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army‚Äôs access to supplies.\nThe siege of Breda is considered Spinola‚Äôs greatest success and one of Spain‚Äôs last major victories in the Eighty Years‚Äô War. The siege was part of a plan to isolate the Republic from its hinterland, and co-ordinated with Olivare‚Äôs naval war spearheaded by the Dunkirkers, to economically choke the Dutch Republic. Although political infighting hindered Spinola‚Äôs freedom of movement, Spain‚Äôs efforts in the Netherlands continued thereafter.\n\nOnce Spinola laid siege to the city, two relief efforts were made, first by the Dutch, then by the British. In the end, the city capitulated to Spinola in an event memorialized in a famous painting.\n(on the next slide)\nThis is the surrender at Breda by Velasquez\ndescribe what you see\n\n|:‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-| | {background-color=‚Äúblack‚Äù} | | ::: notes The reason why the Siege of Breda is important is that is restored the pride and reputation of the Spanish Army. ::: |"

    "text": "Evidence for Active Learning, Study 2\nWe compared students‚Äô self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students‚Äô perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods."
