title: "STAT 375: Teaching Statistics and Data Science"
---

The primary goal of this course is to help first-time GSI appointments become more confident, efficient, and effective teachers. It aims to build in students a curiosity to persistently question their practice: Why am I teaching this particular topic? What is the most important thing that my students learn? How do I know if my students have learned it? Why have I chosen to teach it in the this manner? Why are certain students engaged and succeeding and others not?

There are three integral elements to this course. In person **class meetings** are the core of the experience, when you will encounter new ideas and discuss them in the context of your current teaching. Weekly **assignments** are an opportunity to reflect on the ideas discussed in class as well as readings. **Teaching observations** will occur twice during the semester and give you the opportunity to observe a different classroom environment than your own and receive feedback about your own teaching.
