## Active learning

Those who does the work do the learning.

*Active learning* generally refers to any instructional method that engages students in the learning process beyond listening and passive note taking.

Often but not exclusively includes collaborative learning in small groups.

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 1

![](how-to-teach-without-lecturing/images/pnas-active-learning.png)

These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning.

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 1

![](how-to-teach-without-lecturing/images/pnas-active-learning-2.png)

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 1

If the experiments analyzed here had been conducted as randomized controlled trials of medical interventions, they may have been stopped for benefit---meaning that enrolling patients in the control condition might be discontinued because the treatment being tested was clearly more beneficial.

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 2

![](how-to-teach-without-lecturing/images/active-feelings.png)

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 2

We compared students' self-reported perception of learning with their actual learning under controlled conditions in large enrollment introductory college physics courses taught using 1) active instruction (following best practices in the discipline) and 2) passive instruction (lectures by experienced and highly rated instructors). Both groups received identical class content and handouts, students were randomly assigned, and the instructor made no effort to persuade students of the benefit of either method. Students in active classrooms learned more (as would be expected based on prior research), but their perception of learning, while positive, was lower than that of their peers in passive environments. This suggests that attempts to evaluate instruction based on students' perceptions of learning could inadvertently promote inferior (passive) pedagogical methods.

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 2

![](how-to-teach-without-lecturing/images/active-feelings-2.png)

## Evidence for Active Learning, Study 3

![](how-to-teach-without-lecturing/images/jse-flipped.png)

Results indicate that students in the FC had statistically discernibly higher final performance outcomes compared to the LC delivery with an average difference of 6.9% in performance (Hedge's g = 0.43), though there was evidence of moderation by the presence of weekly in-class quizzes.

Discuss your critiques with a neighbor.

Share your discussion with the class.

## **Active learning protocols**

1.  Peer Instruction (Mazur, 1997)

## Peer Instruction Protocol

1.  Context: provide new model/language for familiar phenomenon.
2.  Question: calibrated to be in the sweet spot of challenging but not too challenging.
3.  Poll (1 min): students wrestle individually, commit to answer, prepare to explain.
4.  Discuss (4 min): explaining can air misunderstanding, peers can be good teachers.
5.  Re-poll (30 sec): groups commits to answer, prepares to explain, feedback to instructor.
6.  Share: air common misunderstandings.
7.  Explain: resolve tension in conflicting answers.

## Active learning protocols

1.  Peer Instruction (Mazur, 1997)
2.  Think-Pair-Share

## Think**-Pair-Share Protocol**

1.  Think: give students \~1 minute to consider the question and articulate their thinking (usually in writing).
2.  Pair: students take turns explaining their thinking to a peer.
3.  Share: pairs share their thinking with the class to air correct and incorrect conceptions.

## Example: Teaching as a Team: Poorly

Consider a specific aspect of or incident in your working relationship with your teaching team that has gone *poorly* or could be *improved*.

1.  **Think**: write a short description on the padlet.
2.  **Pair**: share your experience with a partner and discuss.
3.  **Share**: whole class discussion.

3.  Purposeful pause
4.  Quick Writes

## Purposeful pause

Instructor pauses every \~15 minutes during lecture and asks students to:

-   Take a couple of minutes to summarize in writing what they just learned and jot down any questions or confusions or.

-   Turn to a neighbor and discuss and rework their notes in pairs, including identifying questions or confusions.

## Quick writes

Instructor poses a prompt that students respond to in writing for \~5 minutes or less.

-   prompt might be a conceptual question, or metacognitive/reflective(link is external) question, including asking students to identify the most important takeaway or a point of confusion.

-   can be implemented at many points during a lecture, combined with small- or large-group discussion, and may be collected to inform future class sessions

-   if graded, points are typically awarded for completion/participation.

## **Traps and how to avoid them**

In groups of 4, discuss each of the failure modes and brainstorm a 2 - 5 methods that can be used to avoid them or short-circuit them when they occur. Designate one of your group members to take notes and another as the spokesperson.

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 8)
```

::: notes
During the break, look over the padlet and collect common failure modes and write them on the boards as headings. When the students have completed their discussion, go group by group and ask for the spokesperson to contribute a few thoughts to each heading.

## Your assignment for next class

1.  Select an active learning protocol to implement in your next class: Peer Instruction, Think-Pair-Share, Purposeful Question, Quick Write, Other...
2.  Write a detailed description of how you will facilitate it, including
    -   the concept question / prompt

    -   timing of each element

    -   precisely what students will be asked to do

    -   how groups will be formed
3.  Reflect on how it went
    -   how did it feel to facilitate?

    -   in what ways was it effective/ineffective?

# Teaching Observations

## Teaching Observations, Round 2

Find a *new* partner to observe with over the coming weeks.

-   Decide on a time that will work for each to observe the other in person.

-   Both people need to fill out the observation google form.

Your observations must be complete two weeks from now: November 8th.
