## Teaching as a Team


## The Role of a GSI: The GSI Perspective

Beyond facilitating your section, several other roles emerged:

.pull-left[
**Point of contact**: Link between student and rest of course

**Content Creator**: Write lesson plans, questions, rubrics
]

.pull-right[
**Operations**: Course infrastructure, grading

**Inspirer**: Keep students engaged and motivated
]

.task[
Decide which one of these you *most* identify with.
]


## Discuss

Find 2-3 other people who tend to view their roles **differently** and take turns sharing.

1. Your primary and secondary roles, as you understand them to be.

2. What two activities you spend the most time doing as part of your role.

3. Was there agreement or contrast in how your instructor views your role?
