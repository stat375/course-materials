## Assignment

Please read [this Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/07/11/it-puts-kids-to-sleep-but-teachers-keep-lecturing-anyway-heres-what-to-do-about-it/)Â and post a follow-up comment **on Ed**. Here are some guiding questions:\
\
1. Do you agree with the sentiment of this piece? Have you ever been in a class where lecture was completely ineffective?\
\
2. Can you offer a counterexample---are there situations where lecture is actually valuable and effective?\
\
3. Have you ever been in a class that is not lecture-based? What are some strategies you might suggest for successful alternative teaching strategies?

In place of posting a new comment, you can also reply to your fellow students' comments. Any engagement and input is welcome as long as it's original and respectful
