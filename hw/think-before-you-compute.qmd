## Assignment

**Reading for next class** Please read [this article](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2013/11/the-power-of-patience). and post a comment on Ed.

Some questions that you're welcome to use to prompt your comment:

1.  Roberts is discussing the power of patience in the context of learning art history. How do her ideas relate to the disciplines you're teaching?

2.  Roberts discusses the importance of the "temporal experiences" of students -- the pace and tempo at which learning happens. In your labs when do you think students should work quickly versus slowly?

3.  In what ways do you try and shape the pace of learning? Is the pace of students' learning something discussed by course staff ever?

If you see that many students have already commented, please read through their comments and alternatively respond to their post.
