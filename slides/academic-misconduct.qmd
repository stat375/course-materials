## Discussion

-   For examples of cheating that may occur in your classes, what are ways in which these "fudge" factors would drive cheating?

## Case Studies from the Class

::: notes
-   Many u/GSIs expressed hesitation over reporting cheaters. Further discussion into what drives this would be interesting.
-   Further discussion into u/GSIs' perspectives on the spectrum of cheating would be interesting. Some acts are more egregious than others; how do we think about this?
