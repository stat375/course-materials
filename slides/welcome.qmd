    -   If you can't be in class (and you're well enough to follow along), watch live (or the recording later) on [Panopto](https://duke.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22d6c1d58a-cb6d-4732-9d4b-ae0c011bf767%22)

    -   In class and see someone ask a question on Slack? Please raise it to me!
-   Labs:
    -   Not live streamed / recorded
    -   Lab 2 (next Monday) - individual
    -   Lab 3 onwards - in teams, if teammates are in isolation, set up team Zoom calls
