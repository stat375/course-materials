# Reflections from Learning

## Reflections from learning

Take a moment and jot down an example of a course that you took / lesson that you participated in that ignited your curiosity. Write down another example of a course / lesson where you were supremely incurious / disinterested / bored / disengaged.

::: poll
What characteristics do identify in these two courses? Is your experience consistent with Willingham's argument that curiosity is fostered through appropriately challenging questions?
:::

::: notes
Alternative: Were your students **curious** and engaged this week? Why or why not? What would you change to increase their curiosity? Do you agree with Willingham's argument that curiosity is fostered through appropriately challenging questions?

## Attention

**Attention** determines which aspects of our environment enter short term memory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Class Questions

As a **student**, when / why have you become inattentive in class?

As a **teacher**, when / why have you misdirected student attention?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: notes
things that might come up for students:

-   sources of distraction

-   "boredom" - content too easy or too hard

-   focusing on other events in life

things that might come up for teachers:

-   tangents, drifting away from learning goals

-   (fear of) loss of credibility by students

## Siege of Breda {.smaller}

The siege of Breda of 1624--25 occurred during the Eighty Years' War. The siege resulted in Breda, a Dutch fortified city, falling into the control of the Army of Flanders.

Following the orders of Ambrogio Spinola, Philip IV's army laid siege to Breda in August 1624. The siege was contrary to the wishes of Philip IV's government because of the already excessive burdens of the concurrent Eighty and Thirty Years' wars. The strategically located city was heavily fortified and strongly defended by a large and well prepared garrison of 7,000 men, that the Dutch were confident would hold out long enough to wear down besiegers while awaiting a relief force to disrupt the siege.

::: notes
The Siege of Breda was a dramatic event in Spanish history. It occured in the 17th century as a part of the Eighty years war. The Spanish Army, under the commander Ambrogio Spinola, representing King Philip V of Spain laid siege to the city in August at a time when sieges were thought to no longer be effect tools in a military campaign. The city of Breda was well-defended and were confident they would win.

## Siege of Breda, cont. {.smaller}

Yet despite the Spanish government's opposition to major sieges in the Low Countries and the obstacles confronting any attack on such a strongly fortified and defended city, Spinola launched his Breda campaign, rapidly blocking the city's defences and driving off a Dutch relief army under the leadership of Maurice of Nassau that had attempted to cut off the Spanish army's access to supplies.

The siege of Breda is considered Spinola's greatest success and one of Spain's last major victories in the Eighty Years' War. The siege was part of a plan to isolate the Republic from its hinterland, and co-ordinated with Olivare's naval war spearheaded by the Dunkirkers, to economically choke the Dutch Republic. Although political infighting hindered Spinola's freedom of movement, Spain's efforts in the Netherlands continued thereafter.

::: notes
Once Spinola laid siege to the city, two relief efforts were made, first by the Dutch, then by the British. In the end, the city capitulated to Spinola in an event memorialized in a famous painting.

The reason why the Siege of Breda is important is that is restored the pride and reputation of the Spanish Army.

## Curating Attention

Some tips:

::: nonincremental
1.  Visuals tend to override audio.
2.  What you omit is as important as what you include.
3.  Pick 1-3 take-homes and check that everything students see/hear ties back to them.

## Working Memory

**Working Memory** holds the information - from the environment and from long term memory - that that you can actively think about. Site of consciousness and awareness.

**Chunking** is the process of compressing several bits of information into a single bit.

```
`r emo::ji("smile_cat")``r emo::ji("heart")``r emo::ji("cake")`
```

## Group Discussion

With your group, come up with a list of **5 strategies** that help students chunk the information to make more room in working memory.

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 7, bottom = 0, font_size = "2em")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example from the reading

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/himalayan-inns.png")
```

```{r}
countdown::countdown(minutes = 1, bottom = 0, font_size = "1em")
```

::: notes
Follow up questions:

-   How does this relate to cognitive load?
-   What does this tell us about using world problems?
